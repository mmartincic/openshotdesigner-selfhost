/**
 * Handing a generated file to the browser.
 *
 * Nine places did this, each with its own copy, and comparing them is how the
 * two defects below were found. The mechanics look trivial — make a Blob, make
 * an anchor, click it — which is exactly why nine slightly different versions
 * accumulated and why nothing tested any of them.
 *
 * ## The anchor must be in the document before it is clicked
 *
 * Three of the nine created a detached `<a>` and called `.click()` on it.
 * Chrome tolerates that; **Firefox does not fire the download at all**. So the
 * contacts CSV, the Fountain screenplay and the AV-script CSV exported nothing
 * in Firefox, silently — no error, no file, nothing to report as a bug beyond
 * "the button does nothing".
 *
 * ## Filenames have to survive the filesystem
 *
 * Two of the nine sanitised only whitespace, so a project called
 * `Ocean's 11: Director/Draft "2"` produced a download name containing `/`,
 * `:` and `"`. Those are illegal on Windows and `/` reads as a path separator;
 * the browser mangles the name or refuses the download. `safeFileName` is the
 * one rule now, and it is tested against those characters.
 *
 * ## The BOM is a per-format decision, never a default
 *
 * A UTF-8 byte-order mark is REQUIRED for Excel to read a CSV as UTF-8 — money
 * columns with euro signs and crew names with accents come out as mojibake
 * without one — and is FATAL for the DaVinci Resolve metadata import, where it
 * glues an invisible U+FEFF to the first header so `File Name` no longer
 * matches and Resolve imports nothing while reporting success.
 *
 * Both failures are silent. So `bom` is an explicit argument with no sensible
 * default, and every caller states which world its file is going into.

 * Characters no filesystem in common use will accept, plus control codes.
 *
 * Written with explicit escapes rather than a range like `[ -<]`, which spans
 * U+0020 to U+003C and would quietly swallow every digit and most punctuation.
 *
 * `no-control-regex` is disabled deliberately. The rule exists because a
 * control character in a pattern is nearly always a typo; stripping them from
 * a filename is the one case where matching them is the entire point. A title
 * pasted from another document can carry them, and a control character in a
 * `download` attribute is exactly what a filesystem will not take.

 * with a dot is hidden on Unix, and a name ending in one is invalid on
 * Windows. An input that sanitises away to nothing returns `fallback`, so a
 * project nobody has titled yet still exports as something openable.

 * names for twenty years, and transliterating a Japanese or Greek title into
 * underscores would make the file unfindable by the person who named it.
