 * Project images that live in the asset store, not in project state (rule 26).

 * its own file. Doing it a fourth time by copy would mean four caches, four
 * object-URL lifetimes and four chances to accidentally put base64 back into
 * the project.
 *
 * Why it matters that these are not data URLs: project state is snapshotted for
 * undo and copied wholesale on duplicate. A 200 kB base64 headshot on forty
 * crew is 8 MB inside every one of those copies, and it is the same 8 MB in the
 * IndexedDB record the app rewrites on every edit. Asset ids are ~50 bytes and
 * the bytes are stored once, content-addressed, so two people sharing a
 * headshot share the blob.
 *
  * Ids are `asset-sha256-…` (or `asset-local-…` where hashing was
  * unavailable), which `collectAssetIds` finds anywhere in the
  * project JSON — so anything stored through here travels in an exported
  * package without further work.
