/**
 * Coverage warnings above the shot list.
 *
 * Reads the context directly rather than taking a dozen props — the same
 * reason `inspector/elements/LightInspector` does: a prop list that mirrors
 * the context is just a copy of the context.
 *
 * `scope` decides which shots are examined. Scene scope is what someone
 * blocking a scene wants; project scope is what an AD wants before a schedule
 * meeting, and it is the only scope where "this character is in scene 12 and
 * appears in no shot" can be asked at all.
 *
 * ## Why the ids are rewritten before the domain sees them
 *
 * An actor MARKER is a per-setup floor-plan element. The same performer
 * standing in two setups of the same scene is two elements with two ids, and
 * `Shot.subjectActorIds` points at those element ids. Handing that straight to
 * the domain reports one person twice — "CHARACTER C is in scene 1 but appears
 * in no shot", printed once per marker — which is what this did on the sample
 * project before the mapping below existed.
 *
 * So every marker is reduced to a CANONICAL key first: the script character it
 * plays; failing that its display name; failing that its own element id. Shots
 * are translated through the same map, so both sides of every comparison speak
 * the same identity.
 *
 * Matching unlinked markers BY NAME is a judgement, and it is the same one
 * `locations/linking.ts` already makes for set names: two markers both reading
 * "CHARACTER C" are one performer standing in two setups, not two people who
 * happen to share a name. Getting it wrong costs a merged warning; not doing it
 * costs the identical sentence printed once per marker, which is what this did
 * on the sample project. A marker with no name at all stays its own person,
 * because there is nothing to match on.
