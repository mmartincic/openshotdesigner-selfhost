/**
 * The two downloads the script panel fires.
 *
 * Both were Firefox bugs: each created a DETACHED anchor and called `.click()`
 * on it, which Chrome tolerates and Firefox ignores entirely. Exporting a
 * screenplay in Firefox produced no file, no error, and nothing to report
 * beyond "the button does nothing".
 *
 * The Fountain export had the filename bug too — it replaced whitespace and
 * nothing else, so a screenplay titled with a colon or a slash produced a name
 * the filesystem refuses.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately the exports only. `ScriptPanel` is two thousand lines
 * and its editing, lining and linking behaviour deserve their own file; this
 * one guards the paths that were broken, so they cannot quietly break again.
