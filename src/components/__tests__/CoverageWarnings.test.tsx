/**
 * Coverage warnings — the seam between the shot list and `domain/shots/coverage`.
 *
 * The domain function is unit-tested and was correct throughout; the defect
 * pinned here lived entirely in the adapter, and was found by driving the real
 * app rather than by the suite. An actor MARKER is a per-setup floor-plan
 * element, so the same performer standing in two setups of one scene is two
 * elements with two ids — and the panel printed "CHARACTER C is in scene 1 but
 * appears in no shot" once per marker.
 *
 * BEHAVIOUR-ONLY (see `renderWithProject`): drive the DOM, assert what is
 * visible.
