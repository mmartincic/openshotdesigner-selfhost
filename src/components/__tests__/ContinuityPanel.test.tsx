/**
 * Continuity panel — the seams between the component, the domain and real
 * project data.
 *
 * Every case here is a bug that actually shipped, or the class of one:
 *
 *  - the keywords field ate the comma you typed, because it round-tripped
 *    array→text on every keystroke;
 *  - an unplanned shot on a scheduled setup quietly joined the plan, so the
 *    checklist stopped reporting the shot that was really missed;
 *  - two state updates in one tick dropped the first, because the second read
 *    a stale project.
 *
 * The domain functions behind all of this are unit-tested elsewhere and were
 * green while every one of those bugs was live. That is the point: the defects
 * were at the seam, so the tests have to be too.
 *
 * BEHAVIOUR-ONLY (see `renderWithProject`): drive the DOM, assert what is
 * visible or what got persisted. No props, no callbacks, no internals.
