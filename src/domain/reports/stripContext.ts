 * carried the number inside their label, setup and shot strips carried it
 * nowhere, and no strip carried its location at all — so the table that the
 * whole unit plans its day from answered neither "what scene is this" nor
 * "where".
 *
 * Resolved here, once, from the project, rather than by each strip kind doing
 * its own lookup inside the sheet derivation: a shot's scene is its setup's
 * scene, a setup's location is a canonical `Location` when linked and its own
 * free text otherwise, and a scene's location is the slugline when nothing is
