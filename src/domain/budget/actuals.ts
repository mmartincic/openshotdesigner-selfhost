 * stored, never derived, and the only interesting question here is comparing
 * the two honestly.

 * Honest means (rule 13): an empty ledger sums to zero because nothing was
 * entered AND nothing was spent are indistinguishable at this level, so a
 * variance is only spoken once at least one actual exists. "€0 against €40k"
 * is not "on budget"; it is "nobody has typed anything yet".
