/**
 * Referential integrity on delete.
 *
 * Deleting an entity has to take every reference to it with it, or the project
 * accumulates pointers into nothing: a power consumer hanging on a truss that
 * was struck, a coverage row for a cue that no longer exists. Those degrade
 * quietly — a stub label here, a missing chip there — which is exactly why they
 * survive for months.
 *
 * These are per-entity and typed rather than one generic
 * `removeEntity(kind, id)`. A generic version would need loose types at every
 * call site and would not know that deleting a truss clears three different
 * collections while deleting a cue clears a matrix row. Each function takes
 * only the slices it touches, returns new objects, and is pure.
 *
 * `removePerson` lives in `domain/people/logic.ts` with the rest of the people
 * logic and follows the same shape.
