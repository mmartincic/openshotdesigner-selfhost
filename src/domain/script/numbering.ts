/**
 * Scene numbering (plan §12).
 *
 * Two regimes, and a production moves from the first to the second exactly
 * once, when the script is "locked" for scheduling:
 *
 *  - AUTO: headings are numbered by position, 1..n, recomputed on every edit.
 *    Insert a scene in the middle and everything after it shifts. Fine while
 *    the script is still being written, because nothing refers to the numbers
 *    yet.
 *  - LOCKED: every heading carries an explicit production number that never
 *    changes. A scene inserted between 3 and 4 becomes 3A, the next one 3B; a
 *    scene cut stays in place as OMITTED (see `omission.ts`); a scene removed
 *    for good leaves a gap. Breakdowns, the stripboard, call sheets and every
 *    department's paperwork refer to scenes by number, so a renumber at this
 *    stage would silently invalidate all of it.
 *
 * Omitted headings count in both regimes: an OMITTED slugline is still a line
 * in the script and still owns its number.
 *
 * Pure functions over the minimal line shape — no React, no I/O.
