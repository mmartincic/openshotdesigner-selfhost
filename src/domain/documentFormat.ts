/**
 * Deterministic formatting for documents that leave the machine.
 *
 * A PDF, a print view or a CSV is a *shared* artefact: the producer exports it,
 * the crew reads it, and both must see the same numbers. `Intl` with an
 * implicit locale breaks that promise — `new Intl.NumberFormat(undefined, …)`
 * resolves to whatever locale the exporting browser happens to run, so the same
 * budget renders as `$1,234.50` for one user and `1.234,50 $` for the next.
 * The same applies to `toLocaleString()` with no argument.
 *
 * It also made two tests non-hermetic: they passed on CI (en-US) and failed on
 * any German developer machine, which is the worst possible failure mode —
 * red only where nobody is watching CI.
 *
 * So documents pin their formatting here. Dates and free text on screen
 * deliberately do NOT use this module — a German user should keep seeing
 * German dates in the dashboard. Money and physical quantities are the
 * exceptions, and each for its own reason: money follows its CURRENCY (see
 * `documentLocaleForCurrency`), which is the same on screen and on paper, and
 * a quantity uses a form nobody can misread (see `formatQuantity`).
