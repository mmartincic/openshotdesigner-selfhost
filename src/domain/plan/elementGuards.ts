/**
 * Narrowing a floor-plan element to what it actually is.
 *
 * `FloorPlanElement` is a discriminated union, but a lot of the canvas asks a
 * question the discriminant does not answer directly: "does this element have a
 * second endpoint?", "does it have a width and height?". A wall, a track, a
 * road, a measurement and an arrow all have `x2`/`y2` while sharing no common
 * type name, so code that drags an endpoint was written as `(el as any).x2`.
 *
 * Those casts are not a style problem. `as any` silences the compiler for the
 * WHOLE expression, so `(el as any).x2` keeps compiling after `x2` is renamed,
 * removed, or made optional — and the failure arrives at runtime as NaN
 * coordinates, which draw as an element that has quietly vanished. A guard
 * costs the same at the call site and keeps the check.
 *
 * Structural rather than type-name based on purpose: the question really is
 * "does this element carry endpoints", and answering it by listing type names
 * means every new two-point element has to remember to add itself here.
