/**
 * The shooting-day checklist, derived.
 *
 * The continuity log and the day's tick-off list are the same document — on a
 * set they are the same job, and building them as two screens is how they end
 * up disagreeing. So nothing here stores "this shot is done": a shot is covered
 * when it has a good take, and that is read from the takes every time.
 *
 * Planned and actual stay two separate sets, deliberately. An unplanned shot
 * never joins the plan retroactively; if it did, the checklist could no longer
 * report that 4C was missed — it would just show a day where everything was
 * covered. The wrap report wants both lists, and `dayChecklist` returns both.
 *
 * The day's planned shots are resolved from all three ways of scheduling —
 * scene, setup and shots blocks — for the same reason `reports/dayCast.ts`
 * does: a production that schedules by setup is a path the app supports, and
 * handling only scene blocks would print an empty checklist for it.
