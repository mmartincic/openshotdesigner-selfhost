/**
 * The DaVinci Resolve metadata export.
 *
 * Resolve's importer (Media Pool → right-click → Import Metadata…) matches
 * rows to clips by FILE NAME and maps values to fields by HEADER NAME. Both
 * matches are exact and both fail silently: a renamed, reordered-by-name or
 * prettified header imports nothing at all, and Resolve reports success either
 * way. That is why the header list below is a literal constant checked
 * byte-for-byte against the vendored template in `docs/resolve-metadata-template.csv`
 * rather than derived from anything, and why it must not be "tidied".
 *
 * The template's second row is an instruction row ("Who directed this?") and is
 * documentation, not data — it is never emitted.
 *
 * Everything the app already knows is filled in from the project, which is the
 * whole reason to log takes here instead of in a spreadsheet: of the 29
 * columns, only file name, roll card, take, good take, comments, keywords and
 * white point have no existing source. Rule 13 holds throughout — a value the
 * app does not know is exported as an empty field, never as a plausible guess.
