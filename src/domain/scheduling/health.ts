/**
 * Schedule health warnings (plan §15).
 *
 * The stripboard already knows everything these checks need: which days exist,
 * what is on them, where those things shoot and when the unit is called. What
 * it does not do is read the schedule back and say the awkward thing out loud
 * — that Tuesday moves the whole unit three times, that Wednesday's call is
 * nine hours after Tuesday's wrap, that Thursday has eleven hours of work
 * inside a ten-hour day.
 *
 * Every rule here is arithmetic on data the user already entered. Nothing is
 * inferred and nothing is invented: a day with no wrap time raises no
 * turnaround warning rather than assuming one (rule 13), and a location with
 * no pin contributes no distance rather than counting as the origin.
 *
 * The thresholds are parameters with documented defaults, because they are
 * agreements rather than facts: ten hours' turnaround is the common minimum in
 * several territories and eleven or twelve in others, and a commercial shooting
 * four setups in a studio has a different idea of "too many moves" than a
 * feature on location. A production that disagrees changes the number rather
 * than learning to ignore the list.
 *
 * Planning aid, not compliance (rule 15). None of this is a substitute for the
 * agreement a production actually works under.
